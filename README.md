# Compiler
Compliers are main components in converting any high-level language to assembly or machine level language. This project documents all the steps to build a basic arithmetic compiler with all the operations and later extend the program to generate Fibonacci series, calculating factorial of a number. All the code will be developed using PyCharm IDE with additional packages required apart from python inbuilt interpreter to build compiler. Building a compiler requires basic components like input scanner, parser, interpreter .Scanner to get input from the user and validate input text. Parser to analyze the input and built binary tree by segregating input provided. Interpreter to  perform the operations and the order in which they must be executed. Once the build is complete it should perform at least basic functions like addition, multiplication, subtraction and division
